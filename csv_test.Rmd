```{r}

## Not run: 
## To write a CSV file for input to Excel one might use
x <- data.frame(a = I("a \" quote"), b = pi)
write.table(x, file = "foo1.csv", sep = ",", col.names = NA,
            qmethod = "double")
## and to read this file back into R one needs
read.table("foo1.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", row.names = 1)
## NB: you do need to specify a separator if qmethod = "double".

### Alternatively
write.csv(x, file = "foo2.csv")
read.csv("foo2.csv", row.names = 1)
## or without row names
write.csv(x, file = "no_quote.csv",quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
read.csv("no_quote.csv")

## To write a file in Mac Roman for simple use in Mac Excel 2004/8
write.csv(x, file = "foo4.csv", fileEncoding = "macroman")
## or for Windows Excel 2007/10
write.csv(x, file = "foo5.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-16LE")
